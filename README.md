# Student Grade Prediction using Random Forest
This project predicts the final grade of students based on features such as age, study time, family size, and other relevant factors.

The model uses Random Forest and is trained using two approaches:
1. **Regression**: predicts the exact final grade.
2. **Classification**: predicts the grade category.


The dataset used is publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)
